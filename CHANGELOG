2.0.1 / 2012-05-16

* Enhancements

  * For single-string transliteration to UTF-8, use ActiveSupport::Inflector.transliterate instead of Iconv - possibly a future-proof solution.
  * For whole-file transliteration to UTF-8, warn users if iconv binary is not available in their $PATH.

2.0.0 / 2012-05-08

* Breaking changes

  * New names for options... (not really breaking, these deprecated options are still accepted)
    :errata -> :errata_settings
    :transform -> :transform_settings
    :select -> :pre_select (to avoid conflict with Enumerable#select)
    :reject -> :pre_reject
    :encoding -> :internal_encoding

* Enhancements

  * Every option is documented
  * Refactored to simplify and DRY
  * Thread safe
